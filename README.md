My MSc dissertation project titled: Implementing Vague and Sarcastic Language Recognition for a Python Based Chatbot.

This project looks to investigate current methods for identifying sentiment in text. More specifically it looks at two important components of natural (human) language with the aim of improving the conversational capabilities of a chatbot. 

The result of this dissertation is a complex of neural networks specialized for identifying the presence of vague and sarcastic language. The vague language component of this project was tainted as a result of a lack of reliable data, with a custom corpus being made by myself based on research in the field of linguistics. Due to this the vague language section here should only serve as a proof of concept for a machine learning based approach to semantic identification.
